# OLAP vs OLTP

Online transaction processing (OLTP) involve processing small, fast transactions in real time. OLTP systems are typically used for operational tasks, such as inserting, updating and deleting data in a database. They’re designed to support high-volume, low-latency transactions. Data is stored in a normalized format to avoid redundancy.

Online analytical processing (OLAP) involve processing complex, large-scale queries that require aggregation and analysis from multiple data sources. OLAP systems are typically used for data analysis and reporting tasks, such as generating sales reports or analyzing customer behavior. They’re designed to support complex queries that involve large amounts of data. Data is stored in a denormalized format to improve query performance.
# NoSQL
## Key-value stores
Examples: DynamoDB, Riak, Redis.

The key can only be string, whereas the value can store string, JSON, XML, Blob, Arrays, Maps etc.

Key-value store usually doesn't know about structure of the values. 
However, some key-value stores offer extended functionality or optional features that allow you to work with structured data within the values, including JSON. 
For example, Redis, has modules like RedisJSON that allow you to work with JSON data and create indexes.

## Document databases
Examples: MongoDB , Amazon DocumentDB, OrientDB, Apache CouchDB.

Document databases, associate keys with a complex data schema known as a document. A document is stored in the form of XML or JSON.

Each document can have own set of fields. 
Documents can be indexed which provide further full text search feature.

## Graph databases
Graph databases, like [Neo4j](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-with-neo4j/), sort network information such as social connections. The collection of nodes (or vertices, i.e., a thing, place, person, category, and so on), each reflecting data (properties), are given labels (edges) establishing the relationship between different nodes
## Wide-column stores
Wide-column stores such as Amazon Keyspaces HBase, Google BigTable, Cassandra, MariaDB, and HyperTable store data in columns rather than rows. 

But unlike relational databases (RDBs), columnal formatting and names can vary from row to row inside the same table. Also, each column of a column-oriented database is stored separately on-disk.

Wide column databases, well-suited when dealing with large volumes of data and high write throughput. 
### SQL vs Wide column:
  - No concept of foreign keys or complex table relationships.
  - Allows flexible schema design, enabling the addition or removal of columns without affecting existing data.
  - Generally does not support JOIN operations. Data modeling encourages denormalization and embedding data to avoid joins.
  - Provides limited support for transactions, primarily within a single row or partition. Transactions spanning multiple partitions are not supported.
  - Optimized for simple, read-heavy, and write-heavy workloads. Complex analytical queries are typically handled by other data processing tools.
  - Supports secondary indexes but with limitations and trade-offs. They are not as versatile as SQL indexes.
  - Allows flexibility in choosing different consistency levels, from strong to eventual consistency, depending on the use case.
  - Has limited aggregation capabilities. Complex aggregations are typically performed outside the database using other tools.
  - Do not natively support full-text search. Integration with external search engines is often used for this purpose.
  - Typically do not support stored procedures or triggers.
### Use cases
1. **Time-Series Data**: Efficiently storing and querying time-series data, like sensor data and logs.
2. **Content Management**: Managing content, user profiles, and metadata in flexible schemas.
3. **E-commerce**: Handling product catalogs, pricing, and inventory data at scale.
4. **IoT Applications**: Ingesting and analyzing data from IoT devices in real-time.
5. **User Personalization**: Managing user profiles and providing personalized recommendations.
6. **Event Logging**: Collecting, storing, and analyzing logs in real-time.
7. **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyzing clickstream and user interaction data.
8. **Graph Data**: Storing and querying graph data for social networks and recommendations.
9. **Archiving and Backup**: Long-term data archiving and backup for compliance and historical analysis.
10. **Large-Scale Analytics**: Data warehousing and analytics for vast structured and semi-structured data.
11. **Session Management**: Handling user sessions in web applications.
12. **Retail Catalogs**: Managing product catalogs and inventory data for retail.
## Time series
  
Time series databases (TSDBs) are designed and optimized for efficiently storing, retrieving, and analyzing time-stamped data.
