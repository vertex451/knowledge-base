Ansible automates the management of remote systems and controls their desired state. A basic Ansible environment has three main components:

- **Control node**
A system on which Ansible is installed. You run Ansible commands such as `ansible` or `ansible-inventory` on a control node.
- **Managed node**
A remote system, or host, that Ansible controls.
- **Inventory**
A list of managed nodes that are logically organized. You create an inventory on the control node to describe host deployments to Ansible.
