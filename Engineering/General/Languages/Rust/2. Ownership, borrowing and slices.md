# Ownership

Ownership is a set of rules 
Ownership is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory, which let Rust make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector:
1. Each value in Rust has an owner.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. The value will be dropped when the owner goes out of scope.

## Stack and Heap

All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size

Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack. 
Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.

pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating

Think about the Stack as a stack of plates and about the Heap as a restourant.

ccessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory.

## Variable Scope

A scope is a range within a program for which an item is valid. The item is valid from the point at which it’s declared until the end of the current scope.

Rust calls `drop` which frees the memory automatically at the closing curly bracket.

### String vs &str

String is an owned type and &str is a refferenced type.

`String` type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time.

`&str` is a slice.
In the case of a string literal(&str), we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable.

`String::from`, its implementation requests the memory from the memory allocator at runtime.

In Rust the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.
```
    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
```

When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function called `drop` to free memory. This funciton is called automatically at the closing curly bracket.

## Ways Variables and Data Interact

### Move

Integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5` values are pushed onto the stack:

```
let x = 5; // bind the value `5` to `x`
let y = x; // make a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`
```

A String is made up of the memory on the heap that holds the contents and three parts that is stored in the stack :
1. Pointer
2. Length
3. Capacity

![[String-memory-representation.png]]

```
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1`, Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when `s1` goes out of scope.  Otherwise both `s2` and `s1` after going out of scope will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a _double free_ error.

Next call of s1 will not work:
```
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}, world!", s1); // borrow of moved value: `s1` error 
```

When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to, but s1 is no longer valid, we would say that `s1` was _moved_ into `s2`

Rust will never automatically create “deep” copies of your data.

### Clone

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`:
```
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

#### Stack-Only Data: Copy

Simple types implement the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable. 

Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:
-   Integers
-   Boolean type
-   Floating point types
-   Character type
-   Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.

## Ownership and Functions

Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.
```
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope
    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope
    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward
} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

```

### Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership:
```
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1
    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it
    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope
    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope
    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

# References and Borrowing

If we need to use String variable after we passed to another function, we can return it as a result, but there is much more convenient way to do it - References.
References - is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.
```
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // instead of taking ownership we use ref
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1` but does not own it. Hence, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.

We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_.

## Mutable References

By default, we’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.
But we can modify a borrowed value by using a _mutable reference_:

```
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value, even read only:
```
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s; // Error: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```

We can avoid this situation by using curly brackets:
```
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.
    let r2 = &mut s;
}
```

Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used:
```
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // These scopes don’t overlap, so this code is allowed.
    println!("{}", r3);
```

**The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL for short)**

##### Dangling References

_dangling pointer_--a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else--by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.
```
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s 
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
```

The solution here is to return the `String` directly:
```
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```

# The Slice Type

A slice is a kind of Immutable reference, so it does not have ownership and we unable to change original String by its slice.

Slice stores the reference to the first element and length.

When we get slice from String, it refferenses to string part and as long as slice is in the scope, we unable to change original string:
```
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello"); // type String
    let hello = &s[0..5]; // type &str
    s = String::from("world"); // ERROR: cannot assign to `s` because it is borrowed
    println!("{:?}", hello); // after this line we can change s variable
}
```

`&str` as a param can accept both slices and references to String:
```
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {...}

fn main() {
	let my_string = String::from("hello world");
	
	`first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole
	first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
	
	// references to `String`s, which are equivalent // to whole slices of `String`s
	first_word(&my_string);       // also valid
	
	let my_string_literal = "hello world";

	// slice of literals are literals
	let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
	let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```
