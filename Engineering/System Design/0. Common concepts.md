# Client-server model
The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, defines the interaction between participants.
## Client
A machine or process that requests data or service from a server. Machine can have both roles - be a server for users and a client for db or third party services.
## Server
A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls.
## IP Address
An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4 addresses consist of four numbers separated by dots: `a.b.c.d` where all four numbers are between 0 and 255. Special values include:
- `127.0.0.1`: Your own local machine. Also referred to as `localhost`.
- `192.168.x.y`: Your private network. For instance, your machine and all machines on your private wifi network will usually have the `192.168` prefix.
## Port
In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the same machine without colliding, they pick a **port** to listen on. A port is an integer between 0 and 65,535 (2^16 ports total).

Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for *system(well-known) ports* and shouldn't be used by user-level processes.
- 22: Secure Shell
- 53: DNS lookup
- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTPS
## DNS
Short for Domain Name System, it describes the entities and protocols involved in the translation from domain names to IP Addresses. 
Typically, machines make a DNS query to a well-known entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones) of the requested domain name in the response.
# Networking
## OSI Model
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.
It has 7 Layers:
1. Physical Layer(Ethernet)
	Responsible for the physical connection between devices, defining the hardware, cables, and electrical signals used for data transmission.
2. Data Link Layer(Wifi, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP))
	Manages the communication between devices on the same network
3. Network Layer(IP, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP))
	Handles the routing and forwarding of data packets between networks
4. Transport Layer(TCP, User Datagram Protocol(UDP))
	Provides end-to-end communication and error recovery, including segmentation and reassembly of data, flow control, and error detection.
5. Session Layer(NetBIOS(Network Basic Input/Output System), RPC, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP))
	Manages sessions and connections between applications, allowing them to establish, maintain, and terminate communication.
6. Presentation Layer(Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), ransport Layer Security (TLS))
	Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that data is presented in a format that the application layer can understand.
7. Application Layer(HTTP, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP3), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP))
	Provides application-level services and interfaces, allowing users and applications to interact with the network and access network resources.
## IP
Stands for **Internet Protocol**. IP headers contain essential information, including source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, and packet length. 
Belongs to the Network layer(3) of OSI(Open Systems Interconnection)  Model.
### Responsibilities:
1. **Host Addressing**: assigning a unique numerical address (IPv4 or IPv6) to each device connected to a network.
2. **Routing:** determining the best path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination across a network including intermediate routers and gateways.
3. **Packet Fragmentation and Reassembly:** breaking data into packets for transmission and reassembling received packets into the original data.
4. **Error Handling:** IP provides error detection but not error correction. It can detect errors in transmitted packets and may request retransmission, but it does not correct errors itself.
## TCP
Stands for Transmission Control Protocol - built on top of the IP, allows for ordered, reliable data delivery between machines over the network.
Belongs to the Transport layer(4) of OSI model
### Responsibilities
1. **Connection Establishment and Termination:** TCP uses a three-way handshake process to establish a connection and a four-way handshake to terminate it.
2. **Reliable Data Transfer:** TCP ensures that data sent from one device to another is reliably delivered. It achieves this by using sequence numbers and acknowledgments. If a sender does not receive an acknowledgment within a certain timeout period, it assumes that the data segment was lost and retransmits it.
3. **Ordered Data Delivery:** TCP ensures that data is delivered to the receiver in the same order it was sent. It uses sequence numbers to reorder out-of-sequence data at the receiver's end.
4. **Congestion Control:** TCP monitors network congestion and adjusts its transmission rate accordingly to avoid network congestion and improve overall network efficiency. It uses algorithms like TCP congestion control algorithms (e.g., TCP Reno, TCP Cubic) to adapt to changing network conditions.
## HTTP
The **H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol belongs to the Application layer. This layer is responsible for creating and displaying the data that is sent through the network.
Requests typically have the following schema:
- host: string (example: algoexpert.io) 
- port: integer (example: 80 or 443) 
- method: string (example: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, or PATCH) 
- headers: <key, value=""> pair list (example: "Content-Type" => "application/json") 
- body: opaque sequence of bytes
Responses typically have the following schema:
- status code: integer (example: 200, 401) 
- headers: <key, value=""> pair list (example: "Content-Length" => 1238) 
- body: opaque sequence of bytes
## IP Packet
Sometimes more broadly referred to as just a (network) **packet**, an IP packet is effectively the smallest unit used to describe data being sent over **IP**, aside from bytes. 
An IP packet consists of:
- an **IP header**, which contains the source and destination **IP addresses** as well as other information related to the network
- a **payload**, which is just the data being sent over the network
# Storage
Databases are services that either use disk or memory to do 2 core things: **record** data and **query** data. 
## Disk
Usually refers to either **HDD (hard-disk drive)** or **SSD (solid-state drive)**. 
Data written to disk will persist through power failures and general machine crashes. Disk is also referred to as **non-volatile storage**.

SSD is far faster than HDD (see latencies of accessing data from SSD and HDD) but also far more expensive from a financial point of view. Because of that, HDD will typically be used for data that's rarely accessed or updated, but that's stored for a long time, and SSD will be used for data that's frequently accessed and updated.
## Memory
Short for **Random Access Memory (RAM)**. Data stored in memory will be **lost** when the process that has written that data dies.

- Reading 1mb from RAM is 4 times faster compared to SSD.
- Reading 1mb from SSD is 20 times faster compared to HDD.
# Latency And Throughput
## Latency
Latency refers to the time it takes for a certain operation to complete in a system. Most often, this measure is a time duration, like milliseconds or seconds. 
- **Reading 1 MB from RAM**: 250 μs (0.25 ms)
- **Reading 1 MB from SSD**: 1,000 μs (1 ms)
- **Transfer 1 MB over Network**: 10,000 μs (10 ms)
- **Reading 1 MB from HDD**: 20,000 μs (20 ms)
- **Inter-Continental Round Trip**: 150,000 μs (150 ms)
## Throughput
Throughput is the number of operations that a system can handle properly per time unit. For instance, the throughput of a server can often be measured in requests/queries per second (RPS or QPS).

Note that low Latency doesn't guarantee low throughput. The same is in opposite - low throughput doesn't guarantee low latency.
# Availability
Availability is the ability of a particular server or service being up and running at any point in time, usually measured in percentages. 
## High Availability
High Availability is used to describe systems that have particularly high levels of availability, typically 5 nines or more; sometimes abbreviated as "HA."
## Nines
"Nines" typically refers to percentages of uptime. For example, 5 nines of availability means an uptime of 99.999% of the time. Below are the downtimes expected per year depending on those 9s:
- 99% (two 9s): 87.7 hours
- 99.9% (three 9s): 8.8 hours
- 99.99%: 52.6 minutes
- 99.999%: 5.3 minutes
## Redundancy
Redundancy is the process of replicating parts of a system in an effort to make it more reliable.
## SLA
SLA, short for "service-level agreement," is a collection of guarantees given to a customer by a service provider. 
SLAs typically make guarantees on a system's availability, amongst other things. 
## SLO
It is a specific, measurable target or goal set by a service provider to define the expected level of service quality for a particular aspect of their service.
SLOs are typically used by the service provider's internal teams, including engineering and operations teams. 
For instance, if we say in SLA to our clients that our support response time is within 24 hours, internally, at our SLO, we target to up to 12 hours.
# Caching
- **Cache:** is a high-speed data storage layer that temporarily holds frequently accessed or recently used data, designed to speed up data retrieval and improve overall system performance.

- **Cache Hit:** When requested data is found in a cache.

- **Cache Miss:** When requested data isn't found in cache. 

- **Cache Eviction Policy:** The policy by which values get evicted or removed from a cache. 
  Popular cache eviction policies:
  - *LRU* (least-recently used)
  - *LFU* (least-frequently used)
  - *FIFO* (first in first out)

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A CDN is a third-party service that acts like a cache for your servers. Sometimes, web applications can be slow for users in a particular region if your servers are located only in another region. A CDN has servers all around the world, meaning that the latency to a CDN's servers will almost always be far better than the latency to your servers. A CDN's servers are often referred to as *PoPs* (Points of Presence). Two of the most popular CDNs are *Cloudflare* and *Google Cloud CDN*.
## What can be cached?
- Long running queries
- Queries with the predefined result
- Most frequent requests
## Cache layers
1. **Client-Side Cache**: This is the cache closest to the end-user. Web browsers often use client-side caches to store static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files. This cache helps reduce the need for repeated downloads when a user revisits a website.
2. **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Cache**: CDNs maintain their cache servers worldwide. They store copies of static and dynamic content, distributing it geographically to reduce server load and minimize latency for users in different regions. CDNs are especially useful for serving large media files.
3. **Reverse Proxy Cache**: A reverse proxy server sits between client requests and the origin server. It caches responses from the origin server, serving cached content to clients when possible. This reduces the load on the origin server and improves response times.
4. **Application Cache**: Within the application or web server, an application cache can be implemented. This cache stores frequently accessed data or database query results, reducing the need to query the database repeatedly. It's especially beneficial for dynamic web applications.
5. **Database Cache**: At the database layer, a cache can be implemented to store query results or frequently accessed data. This cache layer helps minimize the overhead of executing complex queries by returning cached results when possible.
6. **Object Cache**: For systems that rely on object storage or key-value stores, an object cache may be used. It stores frequently accessed objects, reducing the need to fetch them from the underlying storage system.
7. **Local Memory Cache**: Some applications maintain an in-memory cache within the application process itself. This cache is used for temporary storage of frequently accessed data, such as configuration settings or session data.
8. **CPU Cache**: At the hardware level, modern CPUs have multiple levels of cache memory, including L1, L2, and sometimes L3 caches. These caches store frequently accessed CPU instructions and data, reducing the time it takes to access them from main memory.

Frequently accessed and less volatile data is cached closer to the user, while more dynamic or infrequently accessed data may be cached deeper within the system.
# Proxies
## **Forward Proxy**(vpn):
A server that sits between a client and servers and acts on behalf of the client, typically used to mask the client's identity (IP address). Note that forward proxies are often referred to as just proxies. Example - VPN.
## Reverse Proxy
A server that sits between clients and servers and acts on behalf of the servers, typically used for logging, load balancing, or caching. Also plays a shield role and defends the server from overload or attacks.
# Load balancer
A type of reverse proxy that distributes traffic across servers. Load balancers can be found in many parts of a system, from the DNS layer all the way to the database layer.
## Server-Selection Strategy
1. **Round Robin**:
   - This is one of the simplest strategies, where requests are distributed sequentially to each server in a circular manner.
   - It ensures that each server gets an equal share of incoming requests, which can be useful when all servers have similar capabilities.
2. **Weighted Round Robin**:
   - Each server is assigned a weight, and requests are distributed based on these weights.
   - Servers with higher weights receive more requests than those with lower weights, allowing for fine-grained control over load distribution.
3. **Random Selection**:
   - Requests are assigned to servers randomly.
   - While simple, this approach can lead to an uneven distribution of traffic, potentially causing some servers to be overloaded.
5. **Performance-Based Selection**:
   - Least connections, Least response time or througput.
   - Requests are then directed to the server with the best performance metrics, such as response time or throughput.
6. **IP-Based Routing**:
   - Also here goes **Hash-Based Routing** and **Sticky Sessions**
   - The load balancer considers the source IP address of incoming requests to route them to specific servers.
   - This strategy is often used for session persistence, where requests from the same client are consistently routed to the same server to maintain session state.
7. **Hash-Based Routing**:
   - A consistent hashing algorithm is used to map requests to servers based on specific request attributes, such as the URL or session ID.
   - This approach ensures that the same request is always routed to the same server, which can be useful for caching or maintaining session state.
8. Path-based Routing(Or URL-based)
   - Is used in Microservices Architecture and CDN.
## Hot Spot
Refers to a situation where a particular server or resource in a cluster receives a significantly higher volume of requests or traffic compared to other servers or resources.
Hot spots can occur for various reasons, including:
- Suboptimal Sharding or Partitioning
- Hashing Function Issues. If the hashing function is poorly designed or if it doesn't evenly distribute requests, it can result in some servers getting more traffic than others.
- Naturally Skewed Workload: In some cases, the workload itself is naturally skewed, meaning that certain requests or resources are more popular or in higher demand than others. For example, a celebrity's instagram page.
# Hashing
## Consistent Hashing
A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table gets resized. It's often used by load balancers to distribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when existing servers are brought down.
## SHA
Short for "Secure Hash Algorithms," the SHA is a collection of cryptographic hash functions used in the industry. These days, SHA-3 is a popular choice to use in a system.

# Key-value store
A Key-Value Store is a flexible NoSQL database that's often used for caching and dynamic configuration. Popular options include DynamoDB, Etcd, Redis, and ZooKeeper.
## Etcd
Etcd is a strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's often used to implement leader election in a system.
## Redis
An in-memory key-value store. Does offer some persistent storage options but is typically used as a really fast, best-effort caching solution. Redis is also often used to implement **rate limiting**.
## ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper is a strongly consistent, highly available key-value store. It's often used to store important configuration or to perform leader election.
# Specialised storage paradigms
## Blob Storage (Binary Large OBject)
- This is sort of like a key-value store but usually blob stores have different guarantees. They might be slower than KV stores but values can be megabytes large (or sometimes gigabytes large). Usually people use this to store things like large binaries, database snapshots, images or other static assets that a website might have.
Examples - Amason S3, Google Cloud Storage.
## Time Series Database (TSDB)
- A TSDB is a special kind of database optimized for storing and analyzing time-indexed data: data points that specifically occur at a given moment in time. 
Examples: InfluxDB, Prometheus, and Graphite.
## Graph Database
  - A type of database that stores data following the graph data model. Data entries in a graph database can have explicitly defined relationships, much like nodes in a graph can have edges.
  - Graph databases take advantage of their underlying graph structure to perform complex queries on deeply connected data very fast.
  - Graph databases are thus often preferred to relational databases when dealing with systems where data points naturally form a graph and have multiple levels of relationships—for example, social networks.
### Cypher
  - A graph query language that was originally developed for the Neo4j graph database, but that has since been standardized to be used with other graph databases in an effort to make it the "SQL for graphs."
  - Cypher queries are often much simpler than their SQL counterparts. Example Cypher query to find data in Neo4j, a popular graph database:
## Spatial Database
A type of database optimized for storing and querying spatial data like locations on a map. Spatial databases rely on spatial indexes like **quadtrees** to quickly perform spatial queries like finding all locations in the vicinity of a region.
### Quadtree
  - A tree data structure most commonly used to index two-dimensional spatial data. Each node in a quadtree has either zero children nodes (and is therefore a leaf node) or exactly four children nodes.
  - Typically, quadtree nodes contain some form of spatial data—for example, locations on a map—with a maximum capacity of some specified number n. So long as nodes aren't at capacity, they remain leaf nodes; once they reach capacity, they're given four children nodes, and their data entries are split across the four children nodes.
  - A quadtree lends itself well to storing spatial data because it can be represented as a grid filled with rectangles that are recursively subdivided into four sub-rectangles, where each quadtree node is represented by a rectangle and each rectangle represents a spatial region.
Examples: PostgreSQL With PostGIS, MongoDB with GeoJSON, Neo4j, Oracle Spatial, MySQL Spatial.
# Replication and sharding
## Replication
The act of duplicating the data from one database server to others. This is sometimes used to increase the redundancy of your system and tolerate regional failures, for instance. Other times you can use replication to move data closer to your clients, thus decreasing the latency of accessing specific data.
## Sharding
Sometimes called **data partitioning**, sharding is the act of splitting a database into two or more pieces called **shards** and is typically done to increase the throughput of your database. Popular sharding strategies include:
- Sharding based on a client's region(USA/EU)
- Sharding based on the type of data being stored (e.g., user data gets stored in one shard, payments data gets stored in another shard)
- Sharding based on the hash of a column (only for structured data)
## Hot Spot
When distributing a workload across a set of servers, that workload might be spread unevenly. This can happen if your **sharding key** or your **hashing function** are suboptimal, or if your workload is naturally skewed: some servers will receive a lot more traffic than others, thus creating a "hot spot."

# Leader election
The process by which nodes in a cluster (for instance, servers in a set of servers) elect a so-called "leader" amongst them, responsible for the primary operations of the service that these nodes support. When correctly implemented, leader election guarantees that all nodes in the cluster know which one is the leader at any given time and can elect a new leader if the leader dies for whatever reason.
## Consensus Algorithm
A type of complex algorithms used to have multiple entities agree on a single data value, like who the "leader" is amongst a group of machines. Two popular consensus algorithms are **Paxos** and **Raft**.
## Leader election flow via ETCD
- Each node on start connects to ETCD and creates a Session.
- To become a leader, a node attempts to acquire a lease associated with the leadership key. Acquiring the lease means that this node has taken leadership.
- The leader, once elected, continuously renews its lease associated with the leadership key. This renewal process ensures that the leader retains its status. Other nodes also monitor this key for changes to detect leadership transitions.
- All nodes continuously monitor the leadership key in ETCD. They observe changes to this key, such as lease expirations or revocations.
- If a node that was the leader loses its lease (no longer the leader), it initiates a graceful handover. This may involve releasing resources, stopping certain activities, or transferring responsibilities to the new leader.
- The node that successfully acquires the lease becomes the new leader. It assumes control of the cluster and begins executing specific actions or decisions on behalf of the distributed system. These actions can vary depending on the application and its requirements.
