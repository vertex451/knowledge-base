## Why do we need URL shortening?

Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.
URL shortening is used to track individual links to analyze audience, measure ad campaigns’ performance, or hide affiliated original URLs.

## Requirements and Goals of the System

### Functional Requirements:

1.  Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This link should be short enough to be easily copied and pasted into applications.
2.  When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.
3.  Users should optionally be able to pick a custom short link for their URL.
4.  Links will expire after a standard default timespan. Users should be able to specify the expiration time.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

1.  The system should be highly available. This is required because, if our service is down, all the URL redirections will start failing.
2.  URL redirection should happen in real-time with minimal latency.

### Extended Requirements:

1.  Analytics; e.g., how many times a redirection happened?
2.  Our service should also be accessible through REST APIs by other services.

## Capacity Estimation and Constraints

Our system will be read-heavy. Let’s assume a 100:1 ratio between read and write.

### Traffic estimates

Assuming, we will have 500M new URL shortenings per month, with 100:1 read/write ratio, we can expect 50B redirections during the same period:
100 * 500M => 50B

What would be Queries Per Second (QPS) for our system? New URLs shortenings per second:
500 million / (30 days * 24 hours * 3600 seconds) = ~200 URLs/s

Considering 100:1 read/write ratio, URLs redirections per second will be:
100 * 200 URLs/s = 20K/s

### Storage estimates

Let’s assume we store every URL shortening request (and associated shortened link) for 5 years. Since we expect to have 500M new URLs every month, the total number of objects we expect to store will be 30 billion:
500 million * 5 years * 12 months = 30 billion

Let’s assume that each stored object will be approximately 500 bytes (just a ballpark estimate–we will dig into it later). We will need 15TB of total storage:
30 billion * 500 bytes = 15 TB

### Bandwidth estimates

For write requests, since we expect 200 new URLs every second, total incoming data for our service will be 100KB per second:
200 * 500 bytes = 100 KB/s

For read requests, since every second we expect ~20K URLs redirections, total outgoing data for our service would be 10MB per second:
20K * 500 bytes = ~10 MB/s

### Memory estimates

If we want to cache some of the hot URLs that are frequently accessed, how much memory will we need to store them? If we follow the 80-20 rule, meaning 20% of URLs generate 80% of traffic, we would like to cache these 20% hot URLs.

Since we have 20K requests per second, we will be getting 1.7 billion requests per day:
20K * 3600 seconds * 24 hours = ~1.7 billion

To cache 20% of these requests, we will need 170GB of memory.
0.2 * 1.7 billion * 500 bytes = ~170GB

One thing to note here is that since there will be many duplicate requests (of the same URL), our actual memory usage will be less than 170GB.

## System APIs

```
createURL(api_dev_key, original_url, custom_alias=None, user_name=None, expire_date=None)

deleteURL(api_dev_key, url_key)
```

## Abuse prevention

A malicious user can put us out of business by consuming all URL keys in the current design. To prevent abuse, we can limit users via their api_dev_key. Each api_dev_key can be limited to a certain number of URL creations and redirections per some time period (which may be set to a different duration per developer key).

## Database Design
1.  We need to store billions of records.
2.  Each object we store is small (less than 1K).
3.  There are no relationships between records - other than storing which user created a URL.
4.  Our service is read-heavy.

### Database Schema

We would need two tables: one for storing information about the URL mappings and one for the user’s data who created the short link.

## Basic System Design and Algorithm

how to generate a short and unique key for a given URL?

Issues to resolve:
1.  If multiple users enter the same URL, they can get the same shortened URL.
2. 1.  What if parts of the URL are URL-encoded? e.g., [http://www.educative.io/distributed.php?id=design](http://www.educative.io/distributed.php?id=design), and [http://www.educative.io/distributed.php%3Fid%3Ddesign](http://www.educative.io/distributed.php%3Fid%3Ddesign) are identical except for the URL encoding.

### a. Encoding actual URL

[[Algorithms#base64|base64]] will give us 64 chars for short url string. Lets figure out the length we need to cover needs:
base64 * 6 letters = key would result in 64^6 = ~68.7 billion possible strings. It covers twice 5 years keys demand.

MD5 hash gives a 128-bit hash value. After base64 encoding, we’ll get a string having more than 21 characters (since each base64 character encodes 6 bits of the hash value). We can take the first 6 letters for the key. But this could result in key duplication.

#### Solving key duplication issue

- We can append an increasing sequence number to each input URL to make it unique and then generate its hash. Possible problems with this approach could be an ever-increasing sequence number. Can it overflow? Appending an increasing sequence number will also impact the performance of the service.
- Or we can append the user id (which should be unique) to the input URL. For not signed in users we don't need to track metadata and can receive the same shortened for the same input url.

### b. Generating keys offline

We can have a standalone **Key Generation Service (KGS)** that generates random six-letter strings beforehand and stores them in a database (let’s call it key-DB).

This KGS can read keys from DB into memory and remove them from DB and give them to Servers

#### What would be the key-DB size? 

With base64 encoding, we can generate 68.7B unique six letters keys. If we need one byte to store one alpha-numeric character, we can store all these keys in:

6 (characters per key) * 68.7B (unique keys) = 412 GB.

#### Isn’t KGS a single point of failure?

Yes, it is. To solve this, we can have a standby replica of KGS. Whenever the primary server dies, the standby server can take over to generate and provide keys.

#### How would we perform a key lookup

We can look up the key in our database to get the full URL. If it’s present in the DB, issue an “HTTP 302 Redirect” status back to the browser, passing the stored URL in the “Location” field of the request. If that key is not present in our system, issue an “HTTP 404 Not Found” status or redirect the user back to the homepage.


## Data Partitioning and Replication

### a. Range Based Partitioning

We can store URLs in separate partitions based on the hash key’s first letter.
This approach can lead to unbalanced DB servers.

### b. Hash-Based Partitioning

To determine the partition we use the hash of the ‘key’ or the short link.

## Cache

### Size

As estimated in Memory Estimate, we need 170GB of memory to cache 20% of daily traffic. Since a modern-day server can have 256GB of memory, we can easily fit all the cache into one machine. Alternatively, we can use a couple of smaller servers to store all these hot URLs.

### Cache eviction policy

Least Recently Used (LRU) can be a reasonable policy for our system. Under this policy, we discard the least recently used URL first. We can use a Linked Hash Map or a similar data structure to store our URLs and Hashes, which will also keep track of the URLs that have been accessed recently.

## Load Balancer

We can add a Load balancing layer at three places in our system:

1.  Between Clients and Application servers
2.  Between Application Servers and database servers
3.  Between Application Servers and Cache servers

## Purging or DB cleanup

- we can slowly remove expired links and do a lazy cleanup. Whenever a user tries to access an expired link, we can delete the link and return an error to the user
- A separate Cleanup service can run periodically to remove expired links from our storage and cache. This service should be very lightweight and scheduled to run only when the user traffic is expected to be low.
-   After removing an expired link, we can put the key back in the key-DB to be reused.

## Telemetry

How many times a short URL has been used, what were user locations, etc.?
We can store this data for each link in separate table in append only manner, without updates DB will be more efficient.

## Security and Permissions

We can store the permission level (public/private) with each URL in the database. We can also create a separate table to store UserIDs that have permission to see a specific URL.
